Day 1: Understanding the Database Structure
Problem Statement

Before writing complex SQL queries, it is important to understand the structure of the database. On Day 1, my goal is to explore the AdventureWorks database to understand what data is available and how it is organized.

Objectives

List all tables in the database.

Identify fact-style and dimension-style tables.

Identify primary keys and foreign keys in key tables.

Why this matters

A solid understanding of database structure helps prevent incorrect joins, improves query performance, and ensures accurate analysis. This step mirrors how a data analyst approaches a new database in a real-world project.
