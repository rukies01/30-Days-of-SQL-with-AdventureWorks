The objective of Day 2 was to understand how transactional data connects with descriptive data in a real-world data warehouse. Specifically, I focused on three analytical questions:

1. Retrieve all sales orders along with the customer name and order date.

2. Show customer name, city, and country for each order.

3. Identify products that have never been sold.

These tasks are common in reporting, sales analysis, and business intelligence scenarios.
