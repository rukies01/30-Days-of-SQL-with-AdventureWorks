This exercise reinforced several key data analytics principles:

The fact table defines the grain of an analysis. Any query involving orders or transactions should start from the fact table to avoid duplication or misrepresentation.

Dimension tables are used to add business context, such as customer identity and geographic location.

Choosing the correct join path is critical to maintaining data integrity. Orders belong to customers, and geography describes customers, not transactions directly.

Identifying unsold products using anti-joins is a powerful technique for uncovering business opportunities, such as discontinued items, marketing gaps, or inventory optimization needs.

Overall, Day 2 strengthened my understanding of how real-world BI datasets are structured and how thoughtful join strategies lead to accurate and meaningful insights.
