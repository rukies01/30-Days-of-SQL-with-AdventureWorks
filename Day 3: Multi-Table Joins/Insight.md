Understanding Schema Relationships

This exercise strengthened my understanding of how fact and dimension tables relate in a star schema. Following foreign key relationships correctly is critical when working with dimensional models.

Aggregation and Business Thinking

While calculating total sales per customer was straightforward technically, it raised important analytical considerations:

Is this lifetime sales or period-specific?

Are returns included?

Should profit be analyzed instead of revenue?

Could customers share the same name (grouping by a stable key is safer)?

This helped shift my mindset from “writing queries” to “thinking like a decision-support analyst.”
