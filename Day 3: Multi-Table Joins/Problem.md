Problem

The objective of today’s challenge was to practice thinking like a data analyst by answering business-relevant questions using SQL.

The specific tasks were:

Retrieve order number, product name, product category, and product subcategory.

Calculate total sales amount per customer.

Identify the top 10 customers by total sales value.

The focus was not just on writing queries, but on understanding relationships within a star schema and extracting meaningful business insights from transactional data.
